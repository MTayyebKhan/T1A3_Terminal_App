## Software Development Plan

### Purpose

The reasoning behind my ruby terminal application is to copy the behaviour of a booking app. Example of this would be when you buy a movie ticket online with the option of adding popcorn and drink with your ticket and where you wish to sit along with being in gold class.

At a high level, the application intends on functioning as an app on your phone like ticketek, something that can be easier and more effiecient to use.

My prior experience working for a cinema dealing with tickets for customers gave me this idea of how can we make an app to produce your ticket that you can bring to the foodary and pay and move on, instead of lining up for a ticket, then lining up for food. Solving this problem saves money for the business as well as saving time for the customer.

So here I present to you is Event tickets, targetted towards cinema business owners aswell as customers who wish to fly through, or make a quick decision on watching a movie.

### Scope

The scope of my terminal application is for event tickets to provide the following core features:
- Buy a Ticket
- Adjust/Edit Tickets
- Cancellation of Tickets
- Receipt

I am confident that I was able to deliver each of these primary features, though many others that I had originally intended to complete did not make the cut.

As this was my first experience developing a terminal application, it was difficult for me to gauge how quickly I was able to complete certain tasks I had set. I am however pleased with what I have produced within only a week.

This assignment is a real skill test of my capabilities at this time of my coding journey.
