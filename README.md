## Software Development Plan

### Purpose

The reasoning behind my ruby terminal application is to copy the behaviour of a booking app. Example of this would be when you buy a movie ticket online with the option of adding popcorn and drink with your ticket and where you wish to sit along with being in gold class.

At a high level, the application intends on functioning as an app on your phone like ticketek, something that can be easier and more effiecient to use.

My prior experience working for a cinema dealing with tickets for customers gave me this idea of how can we make an app to produce your ticket that you can bring to the foodary and pay and move on, instead of lining up for a ticket, then lining up for food. Solving this problem saves money for the business as well as saving time for the customer.

So here I present to you is Event tickets, targetted towards cinema business owners aswell as customers who wish to fly through, or make a quick decision on watching a movie.
